## What The Project Does

This project transforms a static list of hardware into a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard. It allows users to instantly search, sort, and filter over 150 DJ controllers based on various criteria, helping them find the perfect hardware for their needs. The application also provides interactive charts for a high-level overview of the controller market.

* **Visual Data Exploration:** Interactive charts show trends, such as which manufacturers are most popular and how many controllers are released each year.

* **Detailed Information:** Each controller is presented on a card with all relevant specifications in a clean, easy-to-read format.
