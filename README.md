## About The Project

This project transforms a static list of hardware into a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard. It allows DJs to instantly search, sort, and filter a database of over 140 controllers, helping them find the right hardware for their needs when considering the Mixxx platform. The application also provides interactive charts for a high-level overview of the controller market.
